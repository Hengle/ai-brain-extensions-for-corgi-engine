# AI Brain Extensions for Corgi Engine

This project is a set of tools developed to extend the Unity3D [Corgi Engine](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/corgi-engine-2d-2-5d-platformer-26617?aid=1011lHJn).

It features a list of resources that will hopefully improve your game development workflow.

For a tour of [Corgi Engine](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/corgi-engine-2d-2-5d-platformer-26617?aid=1011lHJn) features, please check this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8bAt1i9gfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8bAt1i9gfo).

_Note: this package depends on [AI Brain Extensions for MMTools](https://github.com/thebitcave/ai-brain-estensions-for-mmtools)_

## 1. AI Brain Graph

This tool uses [xNode](https://github.com/Siccity/xNode) to create AI Brain graphs that can generate regular Corgi AI systems.
